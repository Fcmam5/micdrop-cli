# Mic drop

Simple tool for lazy people to cleanup your project folder after finishing your work.

This tool could be helpful if -for example- you work on multiple Node.js microservices per day and you want to cleanup your service directory after finishing work on a certain service. By cleaning-up we mean: Delete [node_modules](https://i.imgur.com/XFqkgwY.jpg), checkout to your main branch (e.g. `develop`) and stop the running Docker containers.
